## Features
- **Custom Dataset Handling**: Automatically processes datasets with subdirectories for each class.
- **Dynamic Class Detection**: Automatically determines the number of classes based on the dataset structure.
- **Model Training**: Includes a training pipeline with loss tracking and accuracy calculation.
- **Inference**: Predicts the class of unseen images or directories of images.
- **Robustness**: Handles variations in lighting, expressions, and occlusions.

## Input-Output
- **Input**: A color image (in `.jpg` or `.png` format) of a personâ€™s face.
- **Output**: A class label identifying the individual or a similarity score for verification.

### Example:
- **Input**: A facial image of an individual.
- **Output**: A class label like "Person A" or a similarity score indicating how closely the input matches stored reference images.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which is effective for image-related tasks. Key components:
1. **Input Layer**: Normalizes RGB face images.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts facial features using convolution, ReLU activation, and pooling.
3. **Embedding Layer**: Converts features into compact face representations.
4. **Classification & Matching**:
   - **Identification**: Uses Softmax for classification.
   - **Verification**: Compares embeddings using similarity measures.
